        <h2> Why I started my crafts</h2>
        <p>
            During the summer time, I would travel up to Canada to stay with my grandma and I got to a certain point
            where alot of things would bore me... Until one day my grandma taught me how to knit. She told me a very
            basic knitting style for a hat and even though I didn't actually follow the pattern I turned it into a
            scarf. </p>
